# Special-Sequences

Fibonacci Sequence is defined recursively by f<sub>1</sub> = 1, f<sub>2</sub> = 1 and f<sub>2</sub> = f<sub>n-1</sub> + f<sub>n-2</sub> for n equal to or greater than 3. First 10 fibonacci numbers are 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55.

Lucas Numbers are sequence of numbers that are defined as L<sub>n</sub> = L<sub>n-1</sub> + L<sub>n-2</sub> where Lsub>0</sub> = 2 and Lsub>1</sub> = 1. First 10 lucas numbers from 1 to 10 are 1, 3, 4, 7, 11, 18, 29, 47, 76, 123.

Zekendorf Representation of positive integer is the unique expression of this integer as the sum of distinct fibonacci numbers, where all of these fibonacci numbers are non consecutive. For instance, 50 = 34 + 13 + 3.
