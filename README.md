# Special-Sequences

Fibonacci Sequence is defined recursively by f1 = 1, f2 = 1 and fn = fn-1 + fn-2 for n equal to or greater than 3. First 10 fibonacci numbers are 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55.

Lucas Numbers are sequence of numbers that are defined as Ln = Ln-1 + Ln-2 where L0 = 2 and L1 = 1. First 10 lucas numbers from 1 to 10 are 1, 3, 4, 7, 11, 18, 29, 47, 76, 123.

Zekendorf Representation of positive integer is the unique expression of this integer as the sum of distinct fibonacci numbers, where all of these fibonacci numbers are non consecutive. For instance, 50 = 34 + 13 + 3.
